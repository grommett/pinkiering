About
---
v1
I'm David. In my past live's I've been a business owner, department director, tehcnical lead and client liaison. At heart, though I'm a developer with an eye for design and motion, after all I did get my degree from an art school.

v2
I can build anything. In several languages on varying platforms. I'm a developer with an eye for design and motion and I love to solve difficult problems. 

I have over eight years experience as a full stack developer and five years experience in advertising. In addition to coding, I've been a business owner, technical lead and client liaison for brands like UPS, Chase and Marriott Hotels.


Why this site?
---
It's difficlut, armed with only a resume, to point to one project that encapsulates the fullrange of my capabilities so I built this site. The goal is to highlight my ablities in:
• Writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• Creating Tests an validating expectations
• Using source control
• Best practices for the deployment process
• Linux server set up and administration



I love languages.
I've been developing for over 15 years in a wide range of languages:
• JavaScript
• PHP
• Python
• HTML
• CSS
