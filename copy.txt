About
---
I can build anything. I'm a developer with an eye for design and motion and I love to solve difficult problems. I have over eight years experience as a full stack developer and five years experience in advertising. In addition to A CODER, I've been a business owner, technical lead, and client liaison for brands like UPS, Chase, and Marriott Hotels.


Why this site?
---
It's difficlut, armed with only a resume, to point to one project that encapsulates the fullrange of my capabilities so I built this site. The goal is to highlight my ablities in:
• Writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• Creating Tests an validating expectations
• Using source control
• Best practices for the deployment process
• Linux server set up and administration
