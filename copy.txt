Hi,

v1
I'm David. In my past live's I've been a business owner, department director, tehcnical lead and client liaison. At heart, though I'm a developer with an eye for design and motion, after all I did get my degree from an art school.

v2
I can build anything. In several languages and platforms. I love to solve difficult problems. I have over eight years experience as a full stack developer and five years experience in advertising. In addition to coding, I've been a business owner, technical lead and client liaison for brands like UPS, Chase and Marriott Hotels.

Because it's difficlut on a resume to point to one project that encapsulates all I'm capable of I built this site to demonstrates by abilities in HTML, CSS, JavaScript

About this site
---
It's difficult, armed with with only a resume, to point to one project that encapsulates all I'm capable of. So I built this site to demonstrate that. Below you'll see projects I've worked on, but just as important is the site itself.

• An eye for design & delighful user interactions
• HTML, CSS (preproccesing with Stylus)
• Javascript
• Server Set up and deployment



I love languages.
I've been developing for over 15 years in a wide range of languages:
• ActionScript 
• JavaScript
• PHP
• Python
• HTML
• CSS
