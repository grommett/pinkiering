# Why this site?
It's difficlut, armed with only a resume, to point to one project that encapsulates the fullrange of my capabilities so I built this site. The goal is to highlight my ablities in:
- Writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Creating tests an validating expectations
- Using source control
- Best practices for deployment
- Linux server set up and administration

## Headline 
Hacker. Mentor. Polyglot.

## Intro
I can build anything. I'm a developer with an eye for design and motion and I love to solve difficult problems. I have over eight years experience as a full stack developer and five years experience in advertising. In addition to A CODER, I've been a business owner, technical lead, and client liaison for brands like UPS, Chase, and Marriott Hotels.
